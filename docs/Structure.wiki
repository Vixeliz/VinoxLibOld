                            ==== Vingl ====
    Vingl.c is where most of the core functionality takes place. It sets up
the default framebuffer and buffer, it also is where most of the drawing
api resides. Inside of vingl vinGLState is where most globals are held.
This is to try and make sure we always know what variables are globals and
which aren't. We have some utility functions in here as well such as begin
camera and begintexture. Ideally these should be split up into other c files,
which I plan to do however I need to change it so they take in parameters instead
of using global state. At every EndFunction the current batch is called so the
correct matrix math is used. VinoxInit will compile the shader programs(one for
the framebuffer and one for the buffer) and set up everything needed to draw.

                            ==== Buffer ====
    Buffer.c is where we actually set up the buffers to try and split it up from
vingl to keep the engine a little more organized. This is also where the user creates
framebuffers however this will be split up as current user framebuffers also have a
vao and vbo when we only need that for the whole screen framebuffer. The reason we have a
default framebuffer is so eventually in the api I can have a way for easy special affects.
