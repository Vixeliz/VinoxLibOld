Rewrite:
* [ ] Look into providing a fixed update loop
* [ ] DrawSprite() a function to draw an animated sprite.
* [ ] Look into lower level functions in relation to gles2
* [ ] audio
* [ ] Draw from topleft corner instead of center?
* [ ] Clean API
* [ ] Different Shapes(LINES, TRIANGLES, QUADS, POINTS)
* [ ] Textures
* [ ] Cameras
* [ ] Rotation
* [ ] Framebuffers
* [ ] Batching
* [ ] Custom shaders
* [ ] Utility functions for applications?
* [ ] Strip down raymath header?

Notes:
* To get an estimate on files that may need to be looked at run 'scc --not-match external --not-match examples --by-file -s complexity'
