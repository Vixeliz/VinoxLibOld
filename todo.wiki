Features:
* [ ] Limit fps
* [ ] Function for updating in a fixed time(like units fixedtimeupdate function)?
* [ ] Audio(miniaudio)
* [X] Dynamically split up draw calls if the amount of vertices is too large that way we don't segfault
* [ ] allow for drawing a part of a texture(this should be easy with texcoords in createQuad)
* [ ] Render stuff to a texture useful for certain things
* [ ] Framebuffer so we can actually do stuff like transparency
* [.] Performance
    * [ ] Batch together all geometry
    * [ ] Only render a batch if it has changed
    * [ ] split up position, coords/textureid, and colors into seperate vbos so we only have to update one at a time
    * [X] Good default value for MAXQUADS
    * [ ] Batch type to make it easier to organize things
    * [X] Instead of over complicating and using an array of arrays just use one array(vertex) detect if it will overfill if so render then clear it

Clean Up:
* [o] Modularize
    1) [X] Seperate all opengl code to other files and functions
    2) [X] Create structures for certain types such as rectangles and camera
    3) [ ] Use cglm types
    4) [ ] Split up functions more
    5) [ ] More files
    6) [X] Seperate example from lib(the example should compile seperatly and be able to use a .a file for the library)
* [ ] Documentation
    1) [ ] Have better comments in the code
    2) [ ] Have a structure file for how the code is layed out(although should explain itself)
