Features:
* [ ] Limit fps
* [ ] Possibly simple collision detection
* [ ] Function for updating in a fixed time(like units fixedtimeupdate function)?
* [ ] Audio(miniaudio)
* [X] Dynamically split up draw calls if the amount of vertices is too large that way we don't segfault
* [ ] allow for drawing a part of a texture(this should be easy with texcoords in createQuad)
* [X] Render stuff to a texture useful for certain things
* [X] Framebuffer so we can actually do stuff like transparency
* [O] Performance
    * [X] Only render a batch if it has changed
    * [ ] split up position, coords/textureid, and colors into seperate vbos so we only have to update one at a time
    * [X] Good default value for MAXQUADS
    * [X] Batch type to make it easier to organize things
    * [X] Instead of over complicating and using an array of arrays just use one array(vertex) detect if it will overfill if so render then clear it

Clean Up:
* [O] Modularize
    1) [X] Seperate all opengl code to other files and functions
    2) [X] Create structures for certain types such as rectangles and camera
    4) [X] Split up functions more
    5) [X] More files
    6) [ ] Shaders in files
    7) [X] Seperate example from lib(the example should compile seperatly and be able to use a .a file for the library)
* [X] Documentation
    1) [X] Have better comments in the code
    2) [X] Have a structure file for how the code is layed out(although should explain itself)

Notes:
* To get an estimate on files that may need to be looked at run 'scc --not-match external --not-match examples --by-file -s complexity'
